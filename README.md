
# TurtleCraft

This Minecraft data pack adds turtles that can be programmed to automate tasks, inspired by the "ComputerCraft" mod. You can use a chat menu to create your own programs or load some of the examples!

TurtleCraft can be installed in servers and includes features designed for multiplayer interactions. It supports multiple turtles running simultaneously on a small server and, for larger scales, there are multiple performance options that can be adjusted in-game.

If you find an issue or have a suggestion, you can [create an issue](https://github.com/Ivaynn/TurtleCraft/issues) or join the [Discord server](https://discord.gg/QAtc7ZgPxS). You can also use this server to share programs or just chat! You can contribute directly by creating a pull request.

## Compatibility Notes

- Made for Minecraft Java Edition, from 1.19.4 to 1.21.5
- Every scoreboard objective, tag and data storage uses the `turtlecraft` prefix
- Blocks at `10028 0 10028` and `10028 1 10028` in every vanilla dimension are replaced with bedrock when the data pack needs to use them. These chunks are force loaded
- Some parts of this data pack need to be updated for every new Minecraft version, making it incompatible until a new version of the data pack is released
