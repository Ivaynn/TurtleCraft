This Minecraft data pack adds turtles that can be programmed to automate tasks, inspired by the "ComputerCraft" mod. With a simplified and user-friendly approach to turtle programming, this data pack can be enjoyed by everyone. It can be used on servers and includes features designed for multiplayer interactions.

The optimization goal was to support multiple turtles running at once on a small server. For larger scales, the data pack includes performance options that can be adjusted in-game to limit potential lag caused by the turtles.

Please note that this is an ongoing project that will be improved over time. If you come across any bugs or issues, please contact me via [Discord](https://discord.gg/QAtc7ZgPxS). You can also use this server to share programs or just chat!
